# Palindrome Checker Page

This is a simple palindrome checker function I created while, working on a fCC certificate project. I added some simple HTML and CSS in order to make it an actual page.

## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript


### What I learned

Learning JavaScript is quite a challenge, especially when self-taught, luckily there is a plethora of resources on the Web that make such a challenge surmountable.
The biggest step up for me, and the main intention of this little project was to learn a proper way of linking JS to HTML which I achieved.


### Continued development

I intend to continue working on improving my knowledge of working with JavaScript as well as increasing my proficiency with HTML and CSS.
